  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I recently graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and a minor in Healthcare Markets.</p>
  <p>I’m passionate about translational and interdisciplinary research, particularly in developing medical devices that support personalized medicine and leverage technology to combat disease. I’m especially interested in innovations that address chronic conditions and mental health — areas where long-term solutions can significantly improve quality of life. I'm drawn to projects that span the full device pipeline, from problem identification and design to testing and iteration.</p>
  <p>Currently, I’m applying to PhD programs and seeking scholarships to support my graduate studies and continue developing technologies that help people live longer, healthier lives.</p>

  <h2>Research Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multimodal AI for de novo CNS Drug Design via Molecular Generation</strong> – Developed a SMILES-based molecular generator fine-tuned with reinforcement learning and guided by multimodal property classifiers to design CNS-optimized compounds with high validity and desirable pharmacological profiles.<a href="AbstractProposal_BMES2025.pdf" download>Download Abstract</a></li>
    <li><strong>Wearable Fall-Risk Sensor</strong> – Designed a motion-tracking device with IMU + ML classifier for elder care.</li>
  </ul>
